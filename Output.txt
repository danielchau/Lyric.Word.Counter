Girls scratch me up like a tiger hologram

Eat the best food

Sorry I made a mess boo
I'm anxious trying to impress you
Yeah I drank too much
Momma always say I think too much
Whatever I'll be in the club
Just trying to make love

I got to take a shit
I hope the toilet ain't dirty
We could get together tonight
But I'm sure eventually you'll probably hurt me
I'm a sensitive thug, I'm a sad man, a bad man
Also a lot of women say I'm pretty rad man

Yeah
You like dancing?
What's your favourite insect mama?
Praying mantis?
I like that one
It looks like a stick sometimes
Whats up with you?
Trying to go home?
Maybe you like the dick sometimes?


She's a tiger hologram
Spot her in the corner like a tiger hologram
Put her on my wall like a tiger hologram


You're cute, what's your name?
Alright then allow you; it's a numbers game
But I got to get numbers to play
But they want to check my funds and my pay
Yo I'm bored of this lameness
Yeah I'm poor but in Shoreditch I'm famous
They give me bare free Adidas trainers you know
You should think about having that face lift you ho
What? I was negging you
If you're not on it I'm not bothered then your friend will do
You mention with me be me thinking you would like
A British guy with brown eyes
Minus four prescription
Yeah yours?
Nah yeah I wear contact lenses
Nah yeah daily disposables
Nah you get used to it it's minor
Back up in the studio with liners
Take me back to foam party day timers
Reebok Classics fake Iceberg, shaped side burns
And when the grime flows was all one liners


Like a tiger hologram
She's rare like a tiger hologram
Catch your eye like a tiger hologram
Scratch you up like a tiger hologram
She's two dimensional but she moves in a threatening way
Like a tiger hologram
She's rare like a tiger hologram
Bruv, she's a tiger hologram

My mama told me save that money, bank accounts, don't spend that bread
Cash out on new necklaces, 14 karat bracelet
Dibble dabble with the lean
Hi-Tech with the cream soda
As I whipped the yola
Lambo red, Coca Cola
My bros, Cosa Nostra
Ridin' on a speedboat
She suckin', lickin', deep-throat
Rey Mysterio
When I'm jumpin' off the top rope
Banana clip with the scope
Wearin' all white
Like I'm the mothafuckin' pope


I'm on a Yamborghini high, flyin' high through the sky, hey yo
Yammy's vision got us rich, catch a nigga flyin' by in a Lambo
Sippin' the Henny got me gone, now I'm gettin' in my zone, hey yo

Where the chiquitas is at? Yamborghini with the shits, yeah
Lil Newport lit, Young Lord with the shits, yeah
I ain't with the game, bitch, she blow my cartridge, yeah
My Jewelry glistening why Iâ€™m always chilly
Can't believe a nigga made a couple milli'
'Bout to cop the house way up in the hillies
With a bad bitch in the Bentley
Wood grain with the roof gone
Make a bitch fold like a futon
Gettin' bread like a crouton
Tell me what the fuck is you on


Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib

OG, nigga keep it low key
Coolin' in the low ride
Tourin' with the Rollies
Rollin', chiefin' OG
Damn I got the smoke right
Let you get the floor seats
Foreign hoes, foreign freaks, all that on the boat trip
Nigga I'm an OG
Gotta it for the dope fiends, product of the dope game


Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout

Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Kushed out, leaned out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout






One mic, in the mothafuckin' studio
Spit gold, when a nigga hit this flow
You sink, we float, no heathens on my boat
Sour diesel when I hit good smoke
Guided by the light, nigga keep your dark
Third eye sharp like a mothafuckin' hawk
Heart stay mellow like a fuckin' meadowlark
Better play smart before you get eatin' by sharks, nigga


Enter the game, know what's up
Little bit of fame, little bit of drugs
Shawty see the chain, same night in her guts
We don't play, UA that's us
Smoking sensi, high sensei in your membrane
Men slay everyday, for the means of justice, trust it
Be the reason why I say "Fuck this, Fuck This"
Elevate my mind, I'ma push it


Ok, I'm smoking up on my herb shuttles
Elevated, nigga that's the motto
Floating up, a nigga live full throttle
That pink moscato, she drink the bottle
Knowledge nigga, crown the kings
Got the wisdom from the light like Socrates
You ain't about that life, nigga drop to your knees
In the presence of mothafuckin' legend my G


G, I'm a legend my G
Reefer blowin', sour diesel potent
Got my 3 eyes open, Pineal gland is swollen
Astral Planes I'm floatin', Goddammit, I'm free
I be God, please you are not in my league
Got the spirit of asata honor I be gavel free
Battle scars in my bars red star I'm elite
UA, elevate, feel the mark of the beast


Herb shuttles, I'm gettin' high
In the solar, nigga fuck the skies
Beast Coast, we on the rise
We resurrected from out your mind
Nigga, from out your mind
Mothafuckas think they good cause they livin' lies
Oh, oh you livin' lies?
But we killin' these niggas, we ain't even trying
Bow down to the pharaoh
Only got time for that good shit and my cashflow
UA niggas save souls
Mix the dream with the mothafuckin' hash so it burn slow
Kick back counting pesos
Do my mind a little different so my mothafuckin' brain grow
Two L's when I take off
You ain't about that life, get your mind up, times up
Elevate, you lil' niggas hella fake
I'm on my shit like toilets
UA gang banging shit like chip throwing tantrums
Motherfuckers can't hang with us
Enlighten like thunder and rain
Fuck America, New World freedom reign
Enlighten like thunder and rain
Fuck America..


This that indigo anthem
Fly like passports, no randoms
Searchin' for that purpose, merge with
A little bit of piece of mind on this earth, bitch
Earth shift of a kind, esoteric tattoos
Mad jewels, cash rules, nothing to the blind
I'm on another plateau, camels get the cash ghost
How I rose, Derrick in his prime
Climb to the top of a mountain, top of your dreams, chop-chop
Then you find a fountain of gleam, fear not
You don't need a pocket of green
Just the gold in your heart and your eyes, Supreme King
Like J's, beat game and receive ring
Metaphor for the lord, and I'mma deploy
Trap jaws on the holy Cross
Lights stream nigga all aboard, the world's yours
So I puff the herb to levitate
Living my life, a God I got faith
Y'all nigga faker than making your own bait
Flatbush, Beast Coast nigga, all day
All about peace and love, of course knowledge
Spreadin' they own peace, they lovin' it cause I'm God sent
Ever since a kid, I was never one to gossip
So watch how you talkin' when you talkin' to them prophets, nigga





I just rolled a cannon up 
It's Mister Tour Around Canada 
Bodies drop they can't handle us 
It's dead smoke call tha ambulance 
We pull up let the hammer bust 
Nina hold ten I guess its hold enough 
I guess it hold enough 
Nina hold ten I guess it hold enough 



Like the dollar in God we trust 
Countin all this money gotta add it up
Dis bitch bad she won't let you fuck 
She feel my waist she feel my hammer tuck 
She tired of you acting tough 
But she like you cuz you buy her stuff 
She call you and I'm not picking up 
I trap all day party in the club 
I got four traps they all do a dub 
Buy me a condo say it's for us 
We just havin sex she think we makin love 
We just havin sex she think we makin love

Nina hold ten I guess it hold enough 



I trap cuz the ain't food in my fridge 
Only milk and egg come in a tin 
Police on me why they want me in 
Like I said I don't know anything 
Lately I haven't been to sleep 
It's dead smoke GME 
It ain't hard to find me 
I had a  way before  
I got four traps they all do a dub 
Buy me a condo say it's for us 
We just havin sex she think we makin love

We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living? And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!"
And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than 
It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah

Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching, nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll
A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position, was black condition, and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hack, and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world, through eye holes, in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position, or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet, like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buccaro roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts, by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Whoâ€™s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

Hittin' corners, thuggin' with the blower, barrel louder than a motor
Keep the engine runnin' when a nigga run up on ya
Another day in sunny California
The Feds takin' pictures and they tappin' Motorolas
Everybody snitchin', gotta live with paranoia
A soldier since the stroller, ask my mama if you doubt that

Turnin' water and power off, got us impatient, powered up
Evictions notices go unnoticed, the final hours up
Livin' off of borrowed time, committin' crimes that's organized
Fortress wasn't fortified, just tryna build my castle up
Dollar and a dream, at night time we maskin' up
The deadly game of tag, the older generations passed to us
I got a clip that's long enough to shoot until the casket come
With it 'till that casket drop, they droppin' when that magnum pop

Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane


Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
HermÃ¨s link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'


I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered


Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yout when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessin's because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud, but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Canâ€™t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshippin'
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life




Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still


Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still


We could fight a war for peace

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down

It's time to give a little to the
Kids in the middle, but, oh until it falls
Won't bother me


Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still

J-J-J-Just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga calm down


Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground, ain't no fist fight bitch I'm blastin'
Niggas say they looking for me, like I'm not right here man
If I tatted tears, I'd be crying to my beard man
Bitch I'm trying to fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.K.A. the man, A.K.A. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second in command
Niggas bring it, talk to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name 


Diss The Boy, are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim

She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to myâ€“


Hiding in the racks

Out the window while the whip's moving, that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX

Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow


Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
Itâ€™s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, Iâ€™m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but thereâ€™s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start


Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

And bitches love me â€˜cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, Iâ€™m shining all week, ho
Iâ€™m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I canâ€™t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, â€˜cause every nigga that Iâ€™m with Taylor'd


Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow


Stay high like how Iâ€™m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds canâ€™t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, â€˜87, the top peeled back


Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything

Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

There's blood in the water
And they are coming to bring me down
What's hope with no savior?
Yeah there is no one in this ghost town


She looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Medusa, Medusa
I've been here alone


And I crumble to pieces
My body, my weakness is on the floor
And the wind will blow and blow
And I won't be here no more

My wishing well has run dry
Stars are dying in the sky
So I shed my blood and tears
I'll show no fear just to survive


She looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Oh Medusa, Medusa
I've been here alone


She says, "Mortal oh you've been chosen
You're beautiful but you're broken
So hold on to this moment
To fight until you're hopeless"

There's secrets and riddles that live in these walls
There's ghosts of past heroes and I hear them call my name
We won't be tame


Oh she looked right through me
And I turned to stone
Medusa, Medusa
I've been here alone

She looked right through me
And I turned to stone

Got a chick, I call her Lola, she feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja and I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras, I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia, she be acting boujee
Then she came through and topped me off, now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the Mafia, her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no, no

Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Who wants my money? I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity

When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned


What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh




Word to my niggas, word to the biggest killer


Yo, uh
We be that elevated mafia, underachieving, lot with us
Nigga, there ain't no stopping us, prosperous off that garlic drug
Mantras when I spit this flow, knowledge filled up in every bar
But I'm guided by the light, no shine
Soldier of The Father, but I ain't no Christian
Underachievers make believers out of heathens
Portraying legends, got greatest presence up in heaven
Sit and roll that dynamite, prickly shit, that porcupine
Pot prescriptions, that funky shit you hit it, then you quit it


Eyes closed, Indian style sitting, my mind zones
Herbal essence, Cali kush, aroma for the stoners
Benjamin Franks on us, can't get a Lincoln out us
Before you think about it, we got it, just being honest
We progress when we ain't tryna, UA, we redefining diamond
What I need, a rhyming sharp nigga, ego-shining
Hear on from here on, if not, you hear wrong
Young intellect with fear gone, I'll take a bear on


Yeah, one time for the niggas in the hood, uh
And all my niggas knowing they be living good, uh, yeah
I am the man, forgive the past
Motherfucker, I'm tryna, I'm tryna, I'm tryna...



A bigger plan, forever young, call a nigga Peter Pan
God told me young that I would be the man, it's evident
Medicine, medical grade, nigga know my preference
Rizla shit, roll it and face it, this weed is limitless
Up the stairs, out of your old ways, elevating your forte
Conscious, up out of deep space, can't relate
That's why we don't bump your mixtape, only keeping good shit on replay
That Marvin Gaye, little Coldplay, maybe Sade


Seven days, seven nights, in the booth straight creating that good music in the soul
Food for thought, you been waiting, right?
Cooking up shit with my apron tight
Listening to this verse might save your life
Hard work put in, automatic goin' win
Had to learn from the sins, but I paid that price
Iâ€™m faded, no not high, dog, I'm faded
Lost some friends in the struggle, I never thought I would make it
Mahdi, my fucking brother, I love you, you were the bravest
Even though I just met you, my heart you are engraved in, Amen


For all my niggas living up, inside the sky
Living on they dreams, elevating they lives
Making they name, chasing the game
How they just giving it up without a, without a..?


How you looking for shit to change if you ain't changing your ways?
Making the same mistakes, defining insane, peep game
Where the children of the light resign
Iâ€™ll consult the free brethren, speak the wisdom on right and wrong
Tough, creating some better men
File now to the kingdom
Cause you know the power comes with the wisdom
Get some, we went from God on a mission
Free you niggas trapped in mental prisons, listen
Roll that trop with that medicine
Underachievers, I represent
Put it down for my niggas man
Keep the bullshit back in the past


I got the illest flow when my spirit glows
Underachieving till the grave, tryna' heal the blows
Limits broke like the levees down in N.O., so we float
Higher teacher, higher learning
That's the knowledge we promote
Eyes focused on our goals, stay counting them pesos
The fountain of youth, founded by conscious UA
Folks, I promise to spread knowledge
Roll up and remain ghost
Pay homage to the prophets
Cause we offer the same coach, nigga




Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool or kick it in the tub
Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club


I got a ho named Reel-to-Reel
She got a buddy named SP 12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are coming real tight
Something to roll to, something to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money, mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they running the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club






From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas popping off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the Gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your macking at these women at the playaz club




You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss goody two shoe I' see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club




Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs closer to home like Seattle
L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shot goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least yeah
Them Playaz Clubs they got right there in the
San Francisco mothafuckin' bay, yeah
Where your Playaz Club at 4?
My Playaz Club right in the heart of Fillmoe
Uh, I feel you boy
Where yours at Fly?
Man, on the corner of Third and Newcomb right in the heart of HP, huh
This is for all you playaz out there mayne
We out at the Playaz Club




Is it alright if I come round? Is it too late if I come now?
Would you stay up to figure this out some way?
If I stay here would you come back? If I stay cool would you be mad?
Would you want me if I want you that way?


Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over


Isn't it strange that every time I look at your name I'm suddenly high?
For you to feel the same I would do almost anything
I'd give away this, give away that, all of my shoes and all of my hats
All I need's you and a bit of music


Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
Isn't it strange? Isn't it strange?
Isn't it strange? Isn't it strange?




Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
X6


I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway


And in the light of day
I didn't know this
And everything she was
I didn't show this
And in the light of day
I didn't know you
But I wanted you to stay and I didn't wanna go
I wouldn't take it away from you, no no


I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway


I could of told you all the time
You wanted to hear it, eyes
I'm seeing it all clear
You seem to be surprised
Remember how we say
Someday we'll set sail
It took me so much, to get to where we are
And right now you are
Slowing me down down, slowing me down down
Trying to get up, you supposed to hold me down
It's different, ambiguous it may seem
The light shines in the dark
I couldn't see
And in the light of day
Everything we dreamed, I didn't know this
It's how you react, it's the kinda dream

But I'm
Tearing up these scenes
Tearing up these scenes
Time it waits for no one, it took me
Twenty six years to feel this something
And i'll be damned if I let it slip away


I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway


I've been lying awake
Up all night
On these higher stakes
In disguise
I've been dying to wake up and find
I've been low
In the light of day
With open eyes
In the time it takes
To decide
That I wanted you to stay and
I didn't wanna go
I wouldn't take it away from you no no



I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway

I was fly like a bird, I had on StÃ¼ssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, â€˜cause her momma got cancer
She canâ€™t work in the states because her green papers ainâ€™t legal
Fuck a "dame un beso", she be like "run de un peso"
Push the molly to Pedro, so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole
She canâ€™t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo-lian
I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, there she get money vicarious off her friends though
Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando
She robbed Birdy for birdies now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy, and Birdy killed my Cuban ho...

All the bitches I fuck are not common
Guaranteed if I fuck her she cumming
If I'm in the room please don't come in
I beat the pussy like it need production
And all she want from me is reproduction
Gotta ask, "Why'd she leave her husband?"
Heard he called up yelling, tweaking, fussing
Talkin' 'bout "it's gon' be repercussions!"
I remember last, last nigga, nigga tried to run up
Got like three concussions
Do you know what you in for?
They copy copy like 10-4
Keep the money 'cause I been poor
All your jewelry like tin foil
Please don't tell your friends where we shopping at
I swear this shit gon' turn into an in-store 
Fuck you need another man for?
Talking to her like a mentor
Talking to her like a nigga Yoda
And she say "I love you", I'm like "Hold up, hold up, hold up"
Hold up, hold up, hold up 
 Back up  shoulder

[Verse 2: Big Sean & A$AP Rocky}
Now every time we in this bitch
You acting like you owe me favors
Acting like you with the shits
But fronting on the homies later
Look, I could tell you're under pressure, baby time to ease up
Young and living single, like your roommate Khadijah
My apologies, why I gotta be
Misogynistic every time we kick it?
Every time I visit, something's different
And every time I leave you know you miss it
Don't be crying on my shoulder every time I'm coming over
Talking 'bout a popcorn and soda, Netflix and chill
When you home alone with no Macaulay Culkin
Sex game had her going crazy
Now I got her ass calling all the time
And I wish I never met her, Carl Thom'
Driving down my street like it's the Autobahn
Getting loud, setting off the car alarms

You got guns, but won't pop 'em
I send niggas to the doctor, I don't care
Xanman, tan money bag, drag, slash bag man
Baghdad land
Talk back, get back slapped with a back hand
Black man, black hand side
Anti-everything since Yams died
And I stand by NY
No who, what, where, why, when

Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm goodâ€¦ You still working?
Tonightâ€¦ Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I wentâ€¦
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shitâ€¦
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm deliriousâ€¦


Cups of the rosÃ©
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and sayâ€¦


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around



I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and sayâ€¦


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around



I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, â€˜cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."



I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then


Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
â€˜Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble




Shout-out my mucus 
'Cause you know that be my slime

Shout-out my mucus
That nigga, that be my slime
That nigga, that be my slime sli-sli-slime sli-sli-slime slime
Okay, what, watch this pussy, ayy ayy, okay


Naruto nine-tailed fox coat fur
I feel like a Gucci ad-lib, burr!
Colder than Coca-Cola mascot, polar bear
Put my sauce on lasagna it could make Garfield purr
I ainâ€™t really fuckin' with these niggas like a dyke 
New Kellogg's tiger I tell 'em earn yo stripes
You tryna be me but bih could never in your life
Even if you had on my sneakers like Bow Wow in Like Mike
Like Gotti nigga, watch me be disgusting
I'ma do 'em dirty like a ringworm ring
Why they be talking like they might know something
Iâ€™m Madagascar, I'm royalty like lemur king
Told her be careful, my penis just like limousine
And I donâ€™t want to eat pussy if it just smell like Hennessy
Star Wars confederate rifle shoot like ray-beam
Watch me spin around 360 quick scope or someting


Ayy, yuh, ayy, water!
Ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy
It's Doktor Avalanche

Stove on me too, uh-huh, old news, uh-huh
Cook a nigga, uh-huh, like stew
They say my flow that gas might burp, excuse you, uh-huh
Where Iâ€™m going, oh, I think your bitch pums
Excuse me don't fumble it
Drive where yo' momma live

That's all folks, uh-huh

You donâ€™t trust me

Dancing with the demons and the divas
Molly water energy releaser
Told her that I love her then I leave her
I turned every doubter to a believer
Itâ€™s that 6, 2 Mcqueens
Diamonds on me, aquafina
Neck piece like a freezer
5 stacks for the Jesus
Smoking souls with the reaper
Pour the lean by the liter
